THIS IS THE SECOND INTRODUCTION VIDEO OF FUNCTIONS.

int compare(int a, int b);  //HERE COMPARE IS NAME OF THE FUNCTION AND  a & b  ARE THE INPUT VALUES WHICH ARE OF TYPE INT.

VOID IS A RETURN TYPE IN WHICH NOTING IS RETURNED.
EXAMPLE:- 
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

void printStuff(){
  cout<<"Hellooo this is priyanshu";
]

int main(){
  printStuff();
  retuen 0;
}

EVERY FUNCTION CAN RETURN ONLY ONE VALUE BUT CAN HAVE MULTIPLE RETURN STATEMENTS.


Q) WRITE A FUNCTION TO ADD TWO NUMBERS?

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int sum(int a, int b){
  int c = a+b;
  return c;
}

int main(){
  int x=3;
  int y=4;
  sum(x,y);
  return 0;
}
