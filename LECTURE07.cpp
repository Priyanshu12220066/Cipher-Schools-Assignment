IN THIS LECTURE I HAVE LEARNT ABOUT ARRAYS.
ARRAYS - IT IS COLLECTION OF ELEMENTS OF SAME TYPE PLACED IN CONTIGUOUS MEMORY LOCATIONS.USED TO STORE MULTIPLE INTEGERS UNDER A SINGLE VARIABLE NAME.
syntax: type array-name[size];
where type means data-type.
  
CODE:
#include<iostream>;
using namespace std;
int main(){
  int a[5];   //array named "a", which can store 6 integers(0-5).
